//Use extension to add properties to the SKPhysicsBodies to make it easier to perform 	operations on the parent sprite node directly from contact logic section


//Still need to implement property observers for fish orientation or velocity


//Define SpriteNode subclass for collectibles
//Define entities and components to implement GKRuleSystem as well as GKAgent/Goal behavior
//Define navigable area with mesh graph or tile node in order to implement pathfinding

//Objectives (Mode1) get a set of collectible items lost at the bottom of the ocean
	     (Mode2) avoid being eaten
	     (Mode3) eat all enemy fish

//IDEA: 	Run a simulation where fish batter randomly and eat each other based on   defined rules; users can place bets on the winning fish; place bets on remaining 3,4,5 fish also; 

//IDEA:	Fish food (certain foods allow ALL fish to grow or are poisonous to ALL fish
	Certain foods allow fish to temporarily change colors and act as the colored fish:

		Carrot (turns fish orange)
		Tomato/Apple (turns fish red)
	
	Foods pics: carrot, mushroom, 
	alternatively, colorize the different foods

Fish contact rules:
	Pink Fish (smallest):
	
	Orange Fish (second smallest):

	Blue Fish: (intermediary)

	Green Fish (second largest):

	Red Fish (largest):
